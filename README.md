# Crunch! - A reflex game coded in Verilog
Contributors: Andrew Choi, Peter Han

This project was for ECE241 (Digital Logic) at the University of Toronto.

Crunch is a game where the user (a hungry alligator!) tries to eat up as many piece of candies as possible. As soon as 

the user eats up the mine, the alligator blows up and it's all over. As soon as the alligator eats the fifth candy, it 

levels up and the objects start flying into its mouth faster and faster. 

The main chunk of the code is in aligator.v
The rest are to initialize images used inside the game.
